                    <h3>Early life</h3>
                    <p>
                        Tupac Amaru Shakur was born on June 16, 1971, in East Harlem, Manhattan, New York City. While born Lesane Parish Crooks, at age one he was renamed Tupac Amaru Shakur. He was named after Túpac Amaru II, a descendant of the last Incan ruler, who was executed in Peru after his revolt against Spanish rule. Shakur's mother Afeni Shakur explained, "I wanted him to have the name of revolutionary, indigenous people in the world. I wanted him to know he was part of a world culture and not just from a neighborhood." Tupac's surname came from Lumumba Shakur, a Sunni Muslim, whom his mother married in November 1968. Their marriage fell apart when it was discovered that Lumumba was not Tupac's biological father.</p>

                <h3>Death</h3>
                <p>Tupac Shakur died on September 13, 1996, at the age of 25, following a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas that left a profound impact on the music world and beyond. The shooting occurred shortly after Tupac attended a boxing match between Mike Tyson and Bruce Seldon, accompanied by Death Row Records CEO Suge Knight. As they were driving down the Las Vegas Strip, a vehicle pulled up alongside them, and shots were fired, striking Tupac multiple times. He was rushed to the hospital, where he fought for his life for six days before succumbing to his injuries.

                    The circumstances surrounding Tupac’s death remain shrouded in mystery and have led to numerous theories regarding who was responsible. The rivalry between East Coast and West Coast rap scenes during the 1990s added to the tension and speculation, with many believing that his murder was linked to the ongoing conflicts within the hip-hop community. Despite extensive investigations, no one has ever been charged in connection with his death, leaving it one of the most infamous unsolved murders in music history.

                    Tupac's legacy continues to resonate through his powerful lyrics, which addressed social issues, identity, and struggle. His impact on hip-hop and culture is undeniable, and he is remembered not only as a talented artist but also as a cultural icon who spoke out against injustice and inequality. The unanswered questions surrounding his death only add to the mystique of his life and work, ensuring that his influence endures long after his passing.</p>
